How to mount and unmount drives using BASH:

1. Check to see what drives are connected:
	sudo fdisk -l

2. Note where drive is located (e.g., sda1) and then add a folder in /mnt:
	cd /mnt
	mkdir sda 

3. Check to see what type of file system drive uses (ext4, ntfs. etc.):
	sudo parted
	print all

4. Mount the drive to the new folder with the type you found
	sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda

5. Confirm mount by displaying filesystem
	df -l
